# Garbage 

`gb` is a lightweight trash utility intended to be a replacement for the dangerous `rm`. Other trash utilities are written in heavy interpreted languages that add unnecessary overhead to your lighning-fast workflow. `gb` intends to be a quicker alternative within your shell.

### Usage

`gb somefile.txt`
`gb --log 10`
`gb --restore ~/important/file.txt`

### Issues

This is not a complete utility. Items that need attention can be found in the script with the TODO prefix.
